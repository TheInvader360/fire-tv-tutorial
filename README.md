A sample application demonstrating how to build a LibGDX Android game that runs on touchscreen devices and FireTV (build a single apk that runs on all platforms).

To simulate various device types on desktop, edit DesktopLauncher and set the isAmazonDevice() and isAmazonFireTVDevice() return values as required.

Open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/TheInvader360/fire-tv-tutorial).
